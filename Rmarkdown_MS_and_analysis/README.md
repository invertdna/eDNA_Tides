This is a manuscript, and attendant analysis / data, composed almost entirely with Rstudio as an experiment in developing more repeatable and efficient science. ("Almost" entirely because I had to play around with some formatting in LaTex, and couldn't immediately do it in Rmarkdown). It is a collaborative effort among Ryan Kelly, Ram√≥n Gallego, and Emily Jacobs-Palmer, in late 2017. Finished February 2018, for publication in PeerJ.
